            <p class="hide-mobile">CORAL came into existence because of the reverence and wonderment that people have for corals and the beautiful environments they create. This appreciation soon turned into a mission to galvanize the SCUBA diving community to take action to protect coral reefs. This small band of coral enthusiasts soon realized it wouldn’t be able to take on the task of protecting coral reefs alone, so CORAL began forging collaborative partnerships with the people who are most closely connected to coral reefs.</p>
