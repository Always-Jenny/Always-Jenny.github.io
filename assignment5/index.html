      <p>Nezuko was a human but turned into a demon when her family was attacked by a demon late one night. As a Demon, however, Nezuko seems to have forgotten a good portion of her memories as a human, besides those related to her family, and thus doesn't retain the exact personality she had before transformation. She is still very caring and protective towards humans who she sees as members of her family, although this is mainly due to the influence Sakonji Urokodaki had on her while she was asleep for two years. Nezuko also retains some of her human emotions, as she has been seen to cry when sad and smile when happy, but in general she appears more detached than her human cohorts, although she is still much calmer and less malicious than most Demons.</p>
      <h2>Who is she?</h2>
      <section class="story">
        <article class="left">
          <h3>Cute demon</h3>
          <p>Nezuko is a petite young girl with fair skin, visibly large, prominent fangs, and sharp, claw-like nails that fade to red where they point. Her hair is long, black and reaches just below her waist, turning a flame-orange color as it passes her elbows, and appears to be crimped into large, straight ridges, worn side-swept drastically to her left. She has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that appear a lighter color around the rims of their irises, slanted downwards towards the sides of her face and framed by notably long eyelashes, the pupils of which can appear slit as she transforms.</p>

          <h3>Transformation (spoilers)</h3>
          <p>When Nezuko transforms into her berserk Demon form during her fight with Daki, she loses both her gag and footwear, as well as the sleeves of her haori and kimono. She grows a short white horn on the right side of her forehead, and a vein-like pattern appears around her left eye, but her most striking new feature is the red and green vine-like pattern that covers her skin, circling around her arms, legs, and chest.</p>
