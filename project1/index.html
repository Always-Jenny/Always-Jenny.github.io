   <h1>Hello</h1> 
   <h2>Honey!</h2>

     <div class="info on honey bees"></div>
        <p>Honey bee is a widely distributed flying insect know for its ability to collect nectar from flowers and produce honey. Honey bees are mustard yellow and brown. They have stocky bodies that are covered with many hairs to which pollen adheres. The honey bee's primary commercial value is as a pollinator of crops.</p>
    <h3>Western honey bee</h3>
        <p>Did you know that one colony of Western honey bees could contain around 30,000 to 80,000 bees, including the queen, drones and workers. Western honey bee queens are the only reproductive females in colonies, and are the mothers of all workers, drones and the next generation of queens. Queens can produce up to 2,000 eggs daily. Western honey bee workers are responsible for building the cells in which queens place their eggs. Once each egg hatches into larva, young workers feed them until, after several molts and a week of feeding; the larvae enter the pupal stage and then emerge as adults.</p>
    <h3>Italian honey bee</h3>
        <p>Italian honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) were the first domesticated honeybees brought to North America. They are gentle and widespread, in part because they are so adaptable to different climates. Their bodies have yellow-brown and dark brown bands. These honey bees reproduce quickly and keep a large colony over the winter. The downside to this is that they need more honey and pollen stored to survive the winter.</p>
    <h3>European dark honey bee</h3>
        <p>The European dark honey bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) is native to Great Britain and is, therefore, more adapted to the local climate. It is a subspecies of the western honey bee, whose original range stretched from west-central Russia through Northern Europe and probably down to the Iberian Peninsula. Eurpoean dark honey bee can be broadly distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration. Overall, when viewed from a distance, they appear blackish, or in mellifera, rich dark brown.</p>
    <h3>Carniolan honey bee</h3>
        <p>The Carniolan honey bee (Apis mellifera carnica, Pollmann) is native to Slovenia, southern Austria, and parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria. It is favored among beekeepers for several reasons, not the least being its ability to defend itself successfully against insect pests while at the same time being extremely gentle in its behavior toward beekeepers. These bees are particularly adept at adjusting worker population to nectar availability. It relies on these rapid adjustments of population levels to rapidly expand worker bee populations after nectar becomes available in the spring, and, again, to rapidly cut off brood production when nectar ceases to be available in quantity.</p>
