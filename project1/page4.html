    <h3>European dark honey bee</h3>
        <p>The European dark honey bee (Apis mellifera mellifera) is native to Great Britain and is, therefore, more adapted to the local climate. It is a subspecies of the western honey bee, whose original range stretched from west-central Russia through Northern Europe and probably down to the Iberian Peninsula. Eurpoean dark honey bee can be broadly distinguished from other subspecies by their stocky body, abundant thoracal and sparse abdominal hair which is brown, and overall dark coloration. Overall, when viewed from a distance, they appear blackish, or in mellifera, rich dark brown.</p>
