    <h3>Italian honey bee</h3>
        <p>Italian honeybees (Apis mellifera ligustica) were the first domesticated honeybees brought to North America. They are gentle and widespread, in part because they are so adaptable to different climates. Their bodies have yellow-brown and dark brown bands. These honey bees reproduce quickly and keep a large colony over the winter. The downside to this is that they need more honey and pollen stored to survive the winter.</p>
