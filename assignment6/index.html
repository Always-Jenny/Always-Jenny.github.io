        <h2>Meatier meals and more playtime might reduce cats’ toll on wildlife</h2>
        <p>Surprisingly simple measures might keep domestic cats from killing a lot of wildlife.</p>
        <p class="extra-content-blurb">Estimates vary, but it’s likely that billions of birds and mammals succumb each year to our outdoor-ranging feline friends. Calls to keep cats indoors are often contentious among cat owners, and cats can sometimes reject colorful collars or loud bells designed to make them more noticeable.</p>

          <h2>For the first time, an exoplanet family around a sunlike star has had its portrait taken.</h2>
          <p>Astronomers used the Very Large Telescope in Chile to snap a photo of two giant planets orbiting a young star with about the same mass as the sun, researchers report July 22 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.</p>
          <p class="extra-content-blurb">The star, called TYC 8998-760-1, is about 300 light-years away in the constellation Musca. At just 17 million years old, the planetary family is a youngster compared with the 4-billion-year-old solar system. Although astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets, most aren’t observed directly. Instead they are spotted as shadows crossing in front of their stars, or inferred as unseen forces tugging at their stars.</p>
